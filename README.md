# ExpenseTracker

Simple tool I use to map bank accounts reports and upload them to google spread sheet

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `expense_tracker` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:expense_tracker, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
